# From 1.x to 2.x
> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is recommended not to migrate to v2 of this package yet. While it was initially based on v2 of Plytix's API, their API was later reclassified as beta after some changes were reverted. This package now reflects those reversions and is tagged as an alpha release, as further breaking changes may occur.
